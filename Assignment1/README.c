Weekly Report:

Design:
This is a simple program that defines the 3 primitive data types in C-programming
and gives them a value. And then prints out the specified value using print statements.
The overall lessons for this week were to learn to be able to assign data types a variable
value.

Psuedo Code:
data_type: char, int, float, char
variable_names: student_id, age, gpa, highest grade;
print(variable_names);

Testing:
input:       Expected output:   Actual Output:

00464132      00464132          157786
21              21              21
2.90            2.90            2.9000
C               C               D

Reflection:
Implementation of this code was not the easiest.
transitioning from Python to programming in C is going
to be a challenge. I ran into errors with the format
specifiers mostly, and learning which specifier is meant
to be used with what data types. I approached this problem
using online resources like programiz.com, i found this
website useful when beginning in a new language. The main
details that were difficult to get working was getting the
print statements to print the actual value that I wanted them
to print rather than the value in ASCII format or other.


Excercises:
2.2)
#define <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello this a simple program");
    return 0;
}
